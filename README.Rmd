# drive_downloaders

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of drive_downloaders is to provide some helper functions for using the
{googledrive} package. Nothing fancy just useful.

```{r}
library(googledrive)
source("drive_downloaders.R")

# .email <- "EMAIL"
# googledrive::drive_auth(.email)

.url <- "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rRPmBZT0OhU-sFDmvWCKEMiYt7Tqh8aM"
.dirname <- "Drive-DL-testing"
drive_download_dir(drive.folder=.dirname)


#install.packages(fs)
library(fs)
dir_tree(path = "Drive-DL-testing", recurse = TRUE)


```
